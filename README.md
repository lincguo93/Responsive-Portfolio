# hw2 Responsive Portfolio
Responsive Portfolio is home work 2 for using bootstrap.
## Description
Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. As future developers, we will likely be asked to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application, and this howwork will show you how we practice to achive this goal. 
After a long time watching videos and researching online, finally I was able to get the wesites to work the way I wanted to meet the requirments.
The one issue that troubles me the most is that when the screen size is shrinking down to 768, the images in the portfolio won't change to a single column , but they will when the size is at 767. Finally I was able to work it out with my study group last minute and continue with other issues.
